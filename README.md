# Intellihack_hiccups_04
Intellihack o4th question

Used LSTM and Moving Average to predict the stock price
The best results shown by LSTM
Then optimized and tuned the parameters to get the best results
Got the best results with a RSME of 2.965485 and MAPE of 1.431358
    predicted the stock price for the next 5 days with a better accuracy xD

Run all cells in the notebook to get the output.
    remove the first cell
    change the path to the dataset in the 5th cell according to your system
